# C Programming

## IO

### EOF

- `EOF` is an integer defined in `<stdio>`, but the specific numeric value dosen't matter as long as it is not the same as any `char` value

## Function

### Arguments - Call by Value

> In C, all function arguments are passed "by value."
>
> When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array - there is no copying of array elements.
